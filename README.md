Capstone Project - Sanctioned Companies
---------------	

## Overview

Capstone Project - Sanctioned Companies is an API that enables users to access information about Brazilian companies, with a particular emphasis on details regarding the companies' partners and any sanctions they may have received from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU). This information holds great significance for public organizations, as they are obligated to adhere to legislation that explicitly forbids entering into contracts with sanctioned companies or those where a partner possesses a sanctioned company.

Currently, this API offers basic functionality, allowing users to:

* Maintain a database of companies
* Maintain a database of partners
* Associate partners with their respective companies
* Maintain a record of sanctions

In the near future, the database will be populated with real data from official sources. Additionally, there are plans to implement more advanced search capabilities to enable users to perform complex queries. The API is in the following URK:

### Set up the Database

This project expect that you have Postgres running. Once you have it, create a `capstone_project` database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres bash -c "createdb capstone_project"
```

Populate the database using the `database.psql` file. From the `capstone_project` folder in terminal run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql capstone_project < database.psql"
```

## Set up the Development Environment

1. To begin, please follow these instructions to install a virtual environment: [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

2. Activate the created virtual environment.

3. Edit the enviroment viriables in `bash.sh` according to your Auth0 and database configurations.

4. Set the rigth permission to the `bash.sh` file:

```bash
chmod +x bash.sh
```

5. Execute `bash.sh` file:

```bash
source ./bash.sh
```

6. Navigate to `.src` and install the project`s dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. From within the `./capstone_project` folder, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=src;
```

8. To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

## Authentication and Authorization

Users of the API can have essentially two roles: `regular users` or `admins`. Admin users have the capability to perform all available operations in the API:

* `get:companies`	
* `post:companies`	
* `patch:companies`	
* `delete:companies`

* `get:partners`	
* `post:partners`	
* `patch:partners`	
* `delete:partners`

* `put:partners`

* `post:sanctions`
* `delete:sanctions`	

On the other hand, regular users can only perform listing operations:

* `get:companies`
* `get:partners`
